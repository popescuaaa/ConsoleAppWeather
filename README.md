# ConsoleAppWeather
# C++ weather predictor 

ConsoleAppWeather is a console application wetaher predictor which uses a **Neural Network** and a big dataset consisting on wetaher forecast data from 2009 to 2018.

**Neural Network** architecture: 

**NET** --> **Layers of Neurons** ( could be considered a separate data type ) --> **Neurons**

# Motivation:
First of all, I have to mention that I've started this projet in order to lern more about Neural Networks and Machine Learning.
It was pretty easy for me to find weather datasets from the past 9 years, which, of course are enoush to train, validate and then test the network, and I decided to make a weather-oriented project ( as a start one )
